# Basketball Team Stats Tool
In this project, you will write a program that reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py`. This data will need to be translated into a new collection of your choosing and the fields need to be changed to something that makes more sense for Python to do its comparisons.


**NOTE**: Python has no concept of actual constants like some other languages out there. But it is a convention in Python to treat ALL CAPS variables as in-fact constants.


**Steps to get started:**

1. Create a new empty script file called `app.py` or `application.py`

2. Inside this new file, you will want a Dunder Main statement:
   For a refresh on Dunder Main:

3. Any print statements or function calls you will want to be inside Dunder Main or inside a main function call that is nested inside Dunder Main.
   If you need a refresh, check out the supplied Project 1 files/workspace for an example.
